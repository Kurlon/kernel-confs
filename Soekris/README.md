I primarily play with two of the original Soekris boxes, the 4501 and 4801. Both are based on the AMD Elan and it's evolution, the GX1. These are advertised as i486 cpus though the GX1 for example supports COMPXCHG8 for example. Depending on who asks, the can act as i586 class or even in some circles i686 class processors though the actual performance doesn't match as the core layout is very 486 like.
