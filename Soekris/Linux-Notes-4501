Setup Grub for serial console

In Progress Kernel conf changes needed:
- CPU to GeodeGX1
- Enable x86 board specific fixups
- - Still won't reboot cleanly, hangs at:

[    1.881154] clocksource: tsc-early: mask: 0xffffffffffffffff max_cycles: 0x3d7e2918fb, max_idle_ns: 440795206096 ns
[    1.891986] Calibrating delay loop (skipped), value calculated using timer frequency.. 533.25 BogoMIPS (lpj=2666290)
[    1.902095] Working around Cyrix MediaGX virtual DMA bugs.

- Timer freq to 100 HZ from 300 HZ
- ATA SC1200 support built in
- NatSemi DP8381 NIC support built in instead of module

Trimming the Systemd fat:
systemctl disable --now getty@tty1
  Impossible to connect to the 'local' tty anyways.

systemctl disable systemd-networkd systemd-resolved
  Kernel bangs up IP via DHCP at boot, setup resolv.conf to use an external resolver instead of chewing up RAM to cache locally.

systemctl disable systemd-userdbd systemd-userdbd.socket systemd-nsresourced
  Will need to reboot to see the HUGE benefit of this, all fancy ways of Systemd trying to 'speed up' lookups against system files like passwords, groups, etc.
