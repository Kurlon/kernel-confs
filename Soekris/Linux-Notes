Setup Grub for serial console

In Progress Kernel conf changes needed:
- CPU to GeodeGX1 for 4801, AMD Elan for 4501
- Enable x86 board specific fixups
- - 4801 Still won't reboot cleanly, hangs at:

[    1.881154] clocksource: tsc-early: mask: 0xffffffffffffffff max_cycles: 0x3d7e2918fb, max_idle_ns: 440795206096 ns
[    1.891986] Calibrating delay loop (skipped), value calculated using timer frequency.. 533.25 BogoMIPS (lpj=2666290)
[    1.902095] Working around Cyrix MediaGX virtual DMA bugs.

- Timer freq to 100 HZ from 300 HZ
- ATA SC1200 support built in for 4801
- Legacy PATA for 4501
- NatSemi DP8381 NIC support built in instead of module
- 4501 doesn't have USB, usable PCI slot, etc, strip out drivers and methods that don't make sense, shrink that kernel.

- 4501 Use -Os instead of -O2

Trimming the Systemd fat:
systemctl disable --now getty@tty1
  Impossible to connect to the 'local' tty anyways.

systemctl disable systemd-resolved
  4501 Kernel bangs up IP via DHCP at boot, setup resolv.conf to use an external resolver instead of chewing up RAM to cache locally. Networkd or some other DHCP client is needed as the kernel honors lease times, but doesn't do renewals?
  Nope, after awhile swap over NFS fails without warning, takes longer when systemd-networkd is in use but still happens under load. Kernel eventually reports that nfs server not responding, despite it being online, and both responding to ping?

systemctl disable systemd-userdbd systemd-userdbd.socket systemd-nsresourced
  Will need to reboot to see the HUGE benefit of this, all fancy ways of Systemd trying to 'speed up' lookups against system files like passwords, groups, etc.
