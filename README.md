Kernel configs for various obscure hardware platforms

I have this bad habit of trying to shove modern(ish) OSs on hardware that has long since passed it's best by date. I figure there might be one other person out there who gets similar urges so... I should share my configs and notes as I play?

Generally speaking, I've tested these confs on the hardware and OS noted, but that doesn't mean they'll work for everyone, or work at all, try at your own risk, these are just examples as starting points.
